                Updating/Downgrading Manually Without Burning Fuses

            <div class="ui divider"></div>
            <p>When you update your system firmware version, your Nintendo Switch burns a microscopic fuse to prevent your Switch from being able to downgrade. Essentially, if a firmware tries to boot but too many fuses are burnt for that specific firmware version, the system will simply power off, preventing you from booting.<br/><br/>
            Hekate, ReiNX and SXOS bypass these fuse checks and the fuse burns. By enabling AutoRCM and then manually updating using ChoiDujourNX, you can keep your Switch in a state where it can be downgraded again the future.<br/><br/>
            You can also use this guide as a way to upgrade your Switch if your Switch does not have access to the internet or is superbanned, and to downgrade your Switch to any firmware version.</p>

                IMPORTANT: Understanding AutoRCM
            </h2>
            <div class="ui divider"></div>
            <p><b style="color:red">A later step will give you the option to enable or disable AutoRCM. </b>AutoRCM is a software method of forcing your Switch to go into RCM on every launch, without the need of a jig or hardmod. Essentially, you are purposefully bricking your Switch in a controlled matter that forces it to launch into recovery. This might sound scary but is not actually dangerous, and can be undone at any time.<br><br>
            AutoRCM has the following benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Switch will not burn any fuses, meaning you can downgrade your Switch to a lower firmware version in the future should the need arise.</li>
                <li>You will never accidentally boot stock firmware, meaning you can avoid having telemetry data accidentally sent to Nintendo.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color:red">AutoRCM has the following disadvantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will not be able to boot your Switch at all without a payload sender.</li>
                <li>Your Switch will not turn off correctly from the Switch OS. You will have to shutdown from a payload like Hekate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is <b>highly recommended that you enable AutoRCM</b> as if you ever boot your Switch without Hekate, your fuses will burn and you will not be able to cleanly downgrade again in the future.
