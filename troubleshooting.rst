Troubleshooting
===============

Something didn't work right? Here are some common problems with their solutions.

........
   
The Homebrew Menu doesn't show anything!
----------------------------------------

This is usually due to an archive metadata bit used by some OS's that Horizon simply can't deal with. Here's how to fix it:

1. Launch into Hekate
2. Select **'Tools > Unset archive bit (all except Nintendo folder)'**

    * This might take a while, be patient.

........

Homebrew Launcher only launches album?
--------------------------------------

Make sure you hold the R button while launching Album or any game. Homebrew Launcher should load now.

........

I've injected the payload but there's a black screen after booting?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Try again. 

Remove everything from your SD card EXCEPT the Nintendo folder. Start the process of installing Atmosphere/Kosmos again.
